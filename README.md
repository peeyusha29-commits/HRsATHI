# Problem Statement

Recruiters today receive hundreds or even thousands of resumes for a single opening.

Current hiring challenges include:

- Manual resume screening
- Time-consuming candidate shortlisting
- Keyword-based ATS missing good candidates
- Recruiter bias
- Lack of explainable candidate ranking

For large organizations, reviewing resumes manually can consume several hours for a single role.
